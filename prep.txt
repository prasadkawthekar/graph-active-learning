To Do-

* Shorten all sections (GD)
* Tweak abstract (GD - on 25th)
* Rewrite introduction and conclusion (GD, JZ - later)
* Rewrite section on Accelerated-S2 around why it is a useful alternative to S2 and with a shorter description of the algorithm (PK)
* Modify psuedo-code of Accelerated-S2 to make it clearer (PK, GD)
* Add example graphs to illustrate differences in the algorithms (PK, GD)
* Add discussion section for experiments (?)
